Some guns doesnt have a good firing rate and have a recoil. so when ever you play always have a good loadout guns like HBr,Asm10,KN-44,AK117 has less recoil and good firing rate for close and long range. SMG's like MSMC, PWD and Pharo has good firing rate and less recoil. And some AR's have good close range better than SMG's. So always make a good loadout

Using Perks, There are few perks which will give you advantage while playing ranked matches and normal matches. Flack Jacket reduce the damgae from Trip Mines, Bombs and Rocket launcher, Skuller gives you a quick moment when you want to move fast. Coolblooded will be invisible to scorestreaks so the scorestreaks skills wont affect you. Deadsilence gives you silent moment so the oponent teams cant hear your footsteps when youre near them


AWARNESS ON MINIMAP: You should be aware of your map. So you can the enemy's location from where they're comming so you can have a good advantage in that


MOTION SKILLSL: Motion skills is youor momemt. The main thing in this to slide and jump when you get shot the sliding and jumps will helps you to dodge the bullets. and when you slide it'll be little tough for the enemy to shoot you. so you get the time to kill them. 


SENSITIVITY: When you increase the sensitivity you can will get a speed camera motion. When you turn the camera you can quickly do it. Make the sensitive in which you can play. In rotation mode you need to fix in fixed speed the momemt speed is set to 100 which is default in speed accelartion the speed is set to 140 the rotation. So fix your sensitive in a way where you can play. 
in speed accelartion rotation mode when your drag your thumb from one side to another it'll move very fast. Fixed speed gives you the proper speed and gives a better advantage. always keep the rotation mode in fixed speed

Attachments like foregrip, Quickdraw will give you less recoil. and extend mag and fast mag gives you mag extension and faster reload. When you're using scope attachment use RedDot cause you will get a better vision then the tatical scope and holographic scope and some guns doesn't need scope cause their iron sight gives you a better vision.
